1 Description
As a data scientist working at the CMPE Airlines, it is your job to always
try new ideas in order to increase the eciency. After working at the CMPE
Airlines for a long time you realize that the passengers are really annoyed by
the long waiting times for luggage hand-in and security checks. Some of the
passengers are even missing their 
ights because of the long waiting times at
the queues. You come up with a few ideas to reduce these waiting times, but
before proposing your ideas to the management board you decide to actually
test your design 'in silico' if the new proposals will work or not on the data
you have.
In the current system there is a rst come rst serve queue before the L
luggage hand-in counters. Whenever there is a free counter , rst person in
the queue goes to the free counter and gives their luggage. After handing in
luggage, they go into a second queue for a security check. This is also a rst
come rst serve queue and there are S security counters. Similarly, whenever
a security counter is free, rst person in the queue goes to that counter for
the security check. This is visualized in the Figure 1.

2 Changes To Implement
You have 3 dierent ideas to make these queues more ecient. You need
to simulate the system and collect data for 8 possible scenarios where you
implement each of these 3 ideas or not. The rst data you need to collect is
the average time between the arrival of a passenger to the terminal and her
departure from the security check. Second data you need to collect is the
number of passengers who are late to their 
ights.
1. Instead of making the queues rst come, rst serve you can make them
rst-to-
y, rst serve. The person who is 
ight is earliest will move to
the rst place of the line. This applies to both luggage hand-in queue
and security queue. You are hoping that this would reduce the number
of people who are late to their 
ights.
2. CMPE Airlines has a special VIP Passenger program. Each passenger
is either in this program or not. As a rm you are trusting these
customers. You decide that you can make these VIP passengers skip
the security queue entirely. You are hoping that this would have an
impact on other people's waiting time as well since VIP passengers
won't keep the security counters busy.
3. As some people do not have a luggage to hand-in, you can implement
an online ticketing system. As a result the people who does not carry a
luggage can skip the rst queue entirely and go in line for the security
2
check immediately. You are hoping that this would have an impact on
other people's waiting time as well, since passengers without a luggage
won't keep the luggage hand-in counters busy.
You are asked to simulate and collect the statistics for each of the 8 cases
in the order given by this table.

3 Input/Output Format
For this project, time will be measured in minutes. Start of the day will
be at 0 minutes. All of the given times in the input will be integers, indicating
how many minutes from the start of the day. Output is also in minutes. As
a result, you do not need to perform time conversions in your code.
3.1 Input Format
The rst line of the input le holds 3 integers, P, L and S, number of
passengers, number of check-in counters and number of security gates.
In the following P lines, the passenger data is given, one passenger per
line. Each line holds 4 integers and 2 characters, the time at which the
passenger will arrive at the airport, the time at which the passenger has to
board her 
ight, the time it will take for her to hand in her luggage, the time
her security control will take and the VIP membership and luggage state of
that passenger. If the passenger is a VIP member the rst character will be
a 'V', otherwise it will be a 'N'. Similarly, if the passenger has a luggage to
hand in, the second character will be a 'L', otherwise it will be a 'N'.

3.2 Output Format
Your program should calculate and print out the two statistics for each
case given in the table in eight separate lines.
 Average waiting time for passengers.
 Number of passengers who get out of the procedure after their boarding
time.
3.3 Example Input
8 2 2
1 10 6 3 N L
3 16 3 6 N N
4 11 2 3 V N
5 15 2 5 N N
6 9 2 1 V N
16 19 1 1 N L
17 26 3 5 N L
18 22 1 3 N L
 There are 8 passengers, 2 luggage counters and 2 security counters.
 The 1st passenger comes to the terminal at 1 minutes. Her 
ight is
at 10 minutes, she will spend 6 minutes on the luggage counter and
she will spend 3 minutes on the security counter. She is not a VIP
passenger and she has a luggage (She has to go to the luggage counter
even if online ticketing is implemented.).
 The 5th passenger comes to the terminal at 6 minutes. Her 
ight is at
9 minutes, she will spend 2 minutes on the luggage counter and she
will spend 1 minutes on the security counter. She is a VIP passenger
and has no luggage. As a result, if online ticketing is implemented she
will skip the luggage counters and go straight into the security queue.
If both online ticketing and no security check for VIP passengers is
implemented she will directly board on her 
ight, waiting for 0 minutes
in the procedure.

 8 lines for each separate simulation cases.
 As an example, compare lines 3 and 4. These are the cases where VIP
security skip is implemented. These lines dier by the queuing rules.
You can see that making the queues rst-to-
y, rst serve we are effectively
reducing the average waiting time and preventing a passenger
from being late to their 
ight. You can see a similar trend on lines 5
and 6, where online ticketing is implemented.
 If you compare the lines 4 and 8, you can also see that implementing all
the options can cause more people to miss their 
ights. This happens
because the passengers 2 and 4 skip the luggage queue and ll both
security counters. They end up blocking passenger 1 from proceeding
with the security check and cause her to miss her 
ight.
4 Grading
Grading of this project is based on the success of your code in test cases.
Your score will be the sum of collected points from each test case. Each test
case will have equal weight. Maximum score is 100.
For each test case total points will be divided to 8 equal parts for each of
the simulation cases. You can still get a partial score by successfully
implementing a subset of these 8 simulation cases. If you decide to
do this, make sure that you print "0 0" for the cases you did not
calculate.

5 Implementation Details
1. Variable limits are as follows:
 1  P  5,000
 1  L; S  20
 1  All the times given in minutes  50,000
2. Execution time limit is 1 seconds. If your code runs more than
1 seconds on a test case you will get 0 points from that test
case.
3. Even if a passenger is already late to their 
ight they will still stay in
the queues. Do not put people out of the procedure based on this.
4. You can safely assume that no two passengers will arrive at the terminal
at the same time or leave luggage counters at the same time.
5. If two dierent events, say a passenger leaving a luggage counter and
another passenger leaving a security counter, is happening at the same
time, the person leaving the luggage counter can occupy the security
counter that was emptied by the other passenger in that instant. Same
thing applies for a passenger arriving at the terminal and another passenger
leaving a luggage counter at the same time. Hint: You can
ensure this by making sure that you simulate simultaneous events in
this order:
(a) A passenger leaving a security counter.
(b) A passenger leaving a luggage counter.
(c) A passenger arriving at the terminal.
6. Your program will be compiled with cmake CMakeLists.txt &&
make command and executed with ./project2 inputFile output-
File command.
6 Warnings
1. Make sure an executable is created after executing cmake CMake-
Lists.txt && make commands. Otherwise, no executable will be
created and your code will fail in grading.
